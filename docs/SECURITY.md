# Security Guidelines

Welcome to the security guidelines for our projects. We take security seriously and encourage everyone to help make our projects as secure as possible. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities, please follow the responsible disclosure process outlined below.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability or concern, please report it to us as soon as possible. You can follow these steps:

1. Email us at support@crimsonsky.com with the details of the issue. Please do not disclose the issue publicly before it has been resolved.

2. Our team will acknowledge and forward your email within 48 hours and work with you to understand and validate the issue.

3. Once the issue is confirmed, we will work on a fix. We appreciate your patience and cooperation during this process.

4. Once the issue is resolved, we will release a security advisory and credit you for your responsible disclosure, if you wish to be credited.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To ensure a safe and collaborative environment for everyone, we ask that you:

- Do not access or modify anyone else's data without explicit permission.
- Do not perform any actions that could negatively impact the availability or performance of the project.
- Do not share any information related to the security issue until it has been resolved.

## How We Handle Security

- We promptly review and prioritize reported security issues.
- We aim to provide fixes in a timely manner and keep the reporter updated on the progress.
- We release security advisories after the issues are resolved and provide credit to the reporter, if desired.
- We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will treat you with respect throughout the process.

## Scope

Please note that our scope of security issues, includes:

- Exploitable vulnerabilities that could lead to cheating, unauthorized access, or manipulation of game assets.
- Security concerns related to multiplayer interactions, player data synchronization, and server-client communication.
- Exploits that affect the fair play, balance, or integrity of the game environment.
- Vulnerabilities within the game's user interfaces that could lead to unintended actions or unauthorized access.
- Any issues that may compromise the user's device, privacy, or personal data through the game.

If you're unsure whether a vulnerability qualifies, please report it anyway, and we'll evaluate it.

Thank you for contributing to the security of our project!
